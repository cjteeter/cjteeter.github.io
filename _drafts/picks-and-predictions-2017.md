*This is a draft.*


Opening Day in MLB is Sunday! Finally! Baseball is back. Before that thought it is time for some annual fun.

As I always say when going through this exercise, making predictions in advance of a baseball season is great fun, but largely foolish. There are so many 
things that can happen between now and the end of the season to affect the standings. Last year, things shook out pretty closely to how [I anticipated](https://christopherteeter.wordpress.com/2016/12/14/season-in-review-2016-picks-predictions-mlb-still-can-sort-of-predict-baseball/). 
Ideally I can repeat my 2016 performance with my predictions for the 2017 season. Here they are:

## Award Picks

Picking the winners of the major awards is always more difficult than picking the playoff teams, as it is not necessarily an attempt to predict how the season
will go for a few players, but rather an attempt to predict how the season will go for a few players _**AND**_ how a group of writers will view how the season 
went for a few players.  

#### American League




#### National League



As always, I will revisit these predictions after the season to check on my accuracy.
