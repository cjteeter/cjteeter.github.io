The 2018 Major League Baseball Hall of Fame inductees will be announced tonight. I suspect it will be a fairly large class, with at least four players gaining
enshrinement. Chipper Jones, Vladimir Guerrero, Jim Thome, and Trevor Hoffman seem like locks, and Edgar Martinez and Mike Mussina will be close. 

Those who have followed my work know that I have engaged in outsider-voting processes at <a href = 'https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/' target = '_blank'>Beyond the Box Score</a>
and for the <a href = "https://ibwaa.com/" target = "_blank"> Internet Baseball Writers Association of America</a> (IBWAA). Two years ago when I posted <a href = 'https://christopherteeter.wordpress.com/2016/01/08/the-2016-hall-of-fame-class/' target = '_blank'>my ballots</a>,
I concluded by saying:

> Completing these Hall of Fame ballots each year is a lot of fun and I look forward to filling them out again next year.

I used to love getting into the weeds on the Hall of Fame election each year. Discussing it with friends, observing all the debates that 
happen online. But now, I no longer find the process to be much fun. Perhaps as another deleterious side effect of the constantly raging dumpster fire that is Twitter, Hall of Fame voting has become another outlet for over-the-top outrage, 
shaming of people who are perceived to know less or think differently, and gross self-aggrandizing.

The incessant bullshit on Twitter is one problem, but it can fairly easily be ignored. The other issue is that over time I have come to realize that the Hall of Fame is so awash in inconsistencies that it has ultimately rendered itself something of a joke. As an example,
consider the Hall's <a href = 'https://medium.com/joeblogs/joe-morgans-letter-9e113815983d' target = '_blank'>very public</a> stance on steroid users. The anti-steroids stuff folds in with
the rest of the ludicrous upholding of the *character clause* as a bastion of morality and impenetrable barrier for evil-doers. But it is silly and applied haphazardly. In the Hall's logic,
steroid users are worse than the group of racists, womanizers, and amphetamine-users who have already gained entry. Why? It simply does not hold up to scrutiny. Nevertheless,
the legend of the magical ball-go-far pills/needles continues unabated. When it is convenient to trot out the character clause the Hall does so, when it isn't they downplay its importance. 
Their wishy-washy ways have led respectable members of the <a href = "https://bbwaa.com/" target = "_blank"> Baseball Writers Association of America</a> (BBWAA) to <a href = 'https://sports.yahoo.com/giving-hall-fame-vote-joe-morgans-letter-144738128.html' target = '_blank'>abstain from voting</a>
until the process is cleaned up.

Consider also the recent election of ex-Commissioner Bud Selig. Selig was an <a href = 'https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2018/1/10/16863052/mlb-collusion-history-bud-selig-free-agency' target = '_blank'>active part</a> of the <a href = 'https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2018/1/18/16882650/mlb-collusion-offseason-free-agency-explainer' target = '_blank'>collusion</a> 
that took place in the late-1980s, had a leading role in the 1994 player's strike, worked hard to implement measures (in-place now) that ensure money is kept away 
from players and stays in the hands of the owners, and was in charge of baseball during the *'steroid era'* that the Hall of Fame finds so abhorrent. It is ridiculous
to be fine with bronzing Selig but be so vehemently opposed to electing greatest-to-ever-play candidates like Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. 

Speaking of collusion and players' rights, why hasn't <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Miller' target = '_blank'>Marvin Miller</a> been elected? Miller
did, perhaps, more than anyone to help players get an equal(ish) stake in the revenue they generate by playing the game. He absolutely has to be in. Unfortunately, he died in 2012 so he missed
the opportunity to experience a celebration of his importance to the game. 

I could go on but fear I have already waded too deep into the waters of the self-aggrandizing Twitterati about whom I complained above. The message is simply that all of the 
nonsense surrounding the Hall of Fame and its processes have significantly reduced my caring about it and my enjoyment in discussing it each year. I will probably still fill 
out my little outsider-IBWAA-ballots each year, and, despite all of the frustration I describe, I still look forward to taking my son through the wonderful exhibits on display in the museum, 
and being there to watch him stare at the walls of the famous faces that mean something to me, but I will work to educate him on what and who is missing from the walls and 
the remarkably silly reasons that are held up to explain why. Maybe my continued, although diminished, engagement makes me part of the problem. After all, the Hall is not going to change
if it can keep selectively celebrating the parts of baseball history they approve, and continue collecting entry fees and getting eyeballs on their website each January. I should be 
rallying for changes to the process (e.g., drop the character clause, implement an objective cutoff for automatic entry, deeper consideration for the historical importance of non-players). 
I suppose that is something I will need to consider over the coming years. 

Without any further adieu, here is the ballot I submitted to the 2018 IBWAA Hall of Fame vote:

1. Barry Bonds
2. Roger Clemens
3. Andruw Jones
4. Chipper Jones
5. Mike Mussina
6. Manny Ramirez
7. Scott Rolen
8. Curt Schilling
9. Gary Sheffield
10. Sammy Sosa
11. Jim Thome
12. Larry Walker

Note that the IBWAA voting process is slightly different than the BBWAA process in two important ways. First, the IBWAA limit is 15 players, five more than the BBWAA. 
Second, members of the IBWAA may elect players in a year that the BBWAA fails to do so. Therefore the players on the IBWAA and BBWAA ballots will differ. For example, 
in previous elections, the IBWAA elected Vladimir Guerrero and Edgar Martinez so these players were not on the IBWAA ballot this year, but they were on the BBWAA ballot.

If I had one, my BBWAA ballot would be as follows:

1. Barry Bonds
2. Roger Clemens
3. Chipper Jones
4. Edgar Martinez
5. Mike Mussina
6. Manny Ramirez
7. Scott Rolen
8. Curt Schilling
9. Sammy Sosa
10. Jim Thome

Vladimir Guerrero, Andruw Jones, Gary Sheffield, and Larry Walker end-up victims of the 10-vote limit.
