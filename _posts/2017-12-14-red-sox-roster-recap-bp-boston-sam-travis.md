Another contribution of mine to this year's BP Boston *Roster Recap Series* went up at the site this morning. I reviewed Red Sox's
top prospect Sam Travis' season. The moves the Red Sox have made at the first base position over the last few offseasons could 
lead one to think they were holding the spot for Travis, with eyes on him starting there last year or this coming year. Unfortunately,
he tore his ACL early in the 2016 season, which disrupted his path to the big leagues, and since returning has not been quite the same
player. Couple that with all the smoke that is building around the idea of the Red Sox signing one or both of J.D. Martinez and Eric
Hosmer -- an idea I really do not like -- and it seems like Travis now projects more as a right-handed bench option than as an 
everyday player for the Red Sox.
