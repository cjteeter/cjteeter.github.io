The current outlook for the Red Sox making the playoffs is very good. They have a 4.5 game lead in the division, and by the 
playoff odds at <a href = "http://www.baseballprospectus.com/odds/" target = "_blank"> Baseball Prospectus</a> and <a href = "http://www.fangraphs.com/coolstandings.aspx" target = "_blank"> Fangraphs</a> 
they are the favourite to win the division, and a near-lock to at least be in the Wild Card game. With that in mind, in my 
article at BP Boston this week I suggested being proactive in thinking about ways to enhance the roster with small, but 
potentially meaningful additions. One major pivot point surrounding this idea is Dustin Pedroia's health. If his knee injury 
is going to prevent him from playing again this season then the team should be looking to shore up the second base position, 
as using Eduardo Nunez or Brock Holt everyday is not ideal for a number of reasons. However, if Pedroia is going to be ready 
come October then covering second base becomes less of an issue, as Nunez and Holt can hold down the fort the rest of the way 
and Pedroia will resume primary duties when the playoffs start.

Independent from the situation of Pedroia's health, I would like the team to add a speed-threat off the bench. This requires 
using a roster spot on a position player who is unlikely to play very much rather than *another* reliever, which, unfortunately, 
teams are loath to do these days. The Red Sox should break the trend of carrying bloated pitching staffs. Having a speedy-player 
available to pinch-run would offer a considerable weapon in an important situation. Getting those extra 90ft could make the 
difference in the outcome of a game.

Yesterday, the Red Sox signed Rajai Davis!

The front office must be following my suggestions ;)
