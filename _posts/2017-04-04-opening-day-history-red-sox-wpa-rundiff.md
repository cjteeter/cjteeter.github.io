The baseball season is upon us and I am extremely excited to have it back. As I noted in my <a href = "http://www.cteeter.ca/blog/2017-03-31-picks-and-predictions-2017/" target = "_blank"> predictions for the season</a>, I expect a strong season from the Red Sox.
They have only played two games, but they won both, looked pretty good in each, and things appear to be headed in the right direction. Opening day of the season is always fun -- I mean Tom
Brady threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Dustin Pedroia, which is great on many levels -- and for one reason or another this year got me thinking about previous years. 
So for my article at BP Boston this week, I explored the history of opening day for the Red Sox. Turns out they have a perfectly even 
record over their 117 year history. How is that possible you wonder? You'll have to read the piece. In addition to their record, 
I highlighted their best wins, lamented their worst losses, as well as identifying the heroes of the games, and the goat-pitchers 
who had ugly starts to the year. It was a fun trip through time.
