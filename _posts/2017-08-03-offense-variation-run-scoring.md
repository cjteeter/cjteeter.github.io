This week at BP Boston I continued my season-long analysis of the Red Sox's offense. I consider myself more of a pitching and defense entusiast, so it is somewhat odd that I have been writing about offense so often this year. 
In any case, in this week's article I focused on something that is often overlooked: variation in run scoring. So often we only talk about a team's 
average runs scored per game, which is a fine measure of an offense's output but doesn't capture the whole story. The extent to which a team varies around that average is also
interesting. For example, if a team averages 6 runs per game by scoring 11 runs in half of their games and 1 run in the other half they, despite that strong average offensive output, are 
probably going to be a .500ish team. Forcing their pitchers to shutout opponents half the time is an unreasonable request and so they are going to lose almost all of those 1-run scored nights. 
Compare that situation with another team that averages 6 runs per game but does it by scoring 7 runs in half of their games and 5 runs in the other 
half of their games, and I suspect you will find this 7-or-5 (low variance team) would be considerably better than the .500 mark and the 11-or-1 (high variance) team. 
Of course this depends on the team's pitching and defense, but, as noted, the 11-or-1 team is making life difficult for their pitchers while the 7-or-5 team 
is giving their pitchers some leeway night-in and night-out. This example, while neatly contrived, demonstrates how only looking at a team's average runs 
per game can miss an aspect of the offense's quality. 

With the importance of variability in run scoring in mind, I looked into the 
variability in the Red Sox's offense and found that they have been more of a high-variance group. They average a good-not-great 4.65 runs per game, but due to
their variable ways it is difficult to know what the offense is going to do night-to-night. Knock-around the trade deadline's would-be <a href = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TEX/TEX201707040.shtml" target = "_blank"> prized starting pitcher</a>,
or get <a href = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI201706150.shtml" target = "_blank"> shutdown by an unheralded rookie</a> with an ERA of 5.52 making his <a href = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.fcgi?id=pivetni01&t=p&year=2017" target = "_blank"> seventh career start</a>. 
Those are cherry-picked examples for sure, but they demonstrate the idea. The Red Sox's offense has been a bit of a roller-coaster. They just have not hit 
that run of consistent strong output that we have been waiting for all season. Hopefully it comes in the next few weeks.
