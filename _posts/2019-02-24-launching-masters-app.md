I posted a new Shiny app to the [Apps](/applications/) page that allows you to play with data from *The Masters* golf tournament. You can interact with a plot of yearly tournament results, explore each year's final leaderboad, sort through historical performance leaderboards, see who are the lowest scorers at Augusta National, and/or focus on one player's career at The Masters.

Check out the [Apps](/applications/) page, or go here: <a href = "https://cjteeter.shinyapps.io/MastersGolf" target = "_blank">Masters Data Viz</a>.

Give it a try and let me know what you think.
