At BP Boston I wrote about David Price again, but this time it was for onfield reasons, which is where I would rather focus. 
The <a href="http://www.cteeter.ca/blog/2017-07-28-david-price-leader-boston-media-fight/" target = "_blank"> fight with 
Dennis Eckersley</a> was a ridiculous distraction and I am glad it is no longer front-page Red Sox news on Apple Watches 
(<a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/sports/baseball/boston-red-sox-stealing-signs-yankees.html" target = "_blank">ugh</a>). 
Rather than Price's fights with the media, we can discuss where he best fits on the team going forward and into the playoffs. 
He is still working his way back from the elbow issue that has kept him off a major league mound for the last six weeks (and 
affected him all season). As he rehabs, an important question is: should he be preparing for life as a starter or a reliever? 
From my perspective the latter option is best.

Head to BP Boston to read more on why I think the Red Sox are best served by moving Price to a relief role: <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017/09/07/david-price-bullpen-bound/" target = "_blank"> David Price, Bullpen Bound?</a>

The Red Sox announced David Price will pitch out the bullpen for the rest of the season!
