My third entry to the <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017-red-sox-roster-recap-series/" target = "_blank"> 2017 BP Boston Roster Recap series</a> went live last Friday. I wrote about recently-crowned Red Sox's 
top-prospect, Rafael Devers. He comes to that title largely because other players were promoted to the big leagues or got traded 
to other organizations, but he is still an exciting player. His main tool is his offense; hitting is what will get him to the 
big leagues. If he can continue to hold-up as a decent defender at third base then he will be a really valuable player. If he 
has to move to first base his value will drop considerably, so hopefully he demonstrates that he will be able to handle the hot 
corner at the big league level.

Head over to BP Boston and read about Devers' strong second-half and my thoughts on his likely development path: <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017/01/13/roster-recap-rafael-devers-can-still-rake/" target = "_blank"> Roster Recap: Rafael Devers Can Still Rake</a>.
