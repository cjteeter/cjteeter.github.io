My second entry to the <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017-red-sox-roster-recap-series/" target = "_blank"> 2017 BP Boston Roster Recap series</a> went live last week. In this instalment I wrote about Dustin Pedroia. 
Pedroia has been a reliable and productive part of the Red Sox organization for almost ten years now, however the last two 
seasons have been derailed by injuries. Last offseason he implemented a new workout regimen that appears to have paid dividends, 
as he was back to his productive self in 2016.

Go check out my thoughts on Pedroia's healthy 2016 and outlook for 2017: <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2016/12/29/roster-recap-a-healthy-dustin-pedroia-is-a-productive-dustin-pedroia/" target = "_blank"> Roster Recap: A healthy Dustin Pedroia is a Productive 
Dustin Pedroia</a>.
