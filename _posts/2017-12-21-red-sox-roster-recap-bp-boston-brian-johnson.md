We are working our way to the end of this year's BP Boston *Roster Recap Series*, as such I wrote about left-handed pitching
prospect (sort of) Brian Johnson. Johnson has had a tough go of it over the last few seasons. He has dealt with injuries, bad luck,
and, perhaps most importantly, anxiety. He has worked hard to continue his baseball life, and for that reason it was good to see him back out on a mound. 
He pitched well for Pawtucket in 2017, earning a couple of promotions to the big leagues where unfortunately, outside of <a href = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS201705270.shtml" target = "_blank">one magical start</a>
at Fenway Park in late May, he struggled. Heading into 2018, Johnson will again serve as part of the ever-important starting pitching depth
the Red Sox will need to navigate the season.
