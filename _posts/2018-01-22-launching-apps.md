I launched an [Apps](/applications/) page that has information and links to <a href = "https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target = "_blank">Shiny Apps</a>
I have developed. At the time of this post, there are two apps on the page:

1. <a href = "https://cjteeter.shinyapps.io/DecisionMaker/" target = "_blank">Decision Maker</a>
2. <a href = "https://cjteeter.shinyapps.io/MLBTeamSynchrony/" target = "_blank">MLB Team Synchrony</a>

**Decision Maker** takes input on options for a decision you are considering and returns a choice. It is intended for
people like me who perpetually overthink simple things. 

**MLB Team Synchrony** uses major league baseball data from 1998-2017 to 
allow users to examine how teams' run scoring and run prevention varied over the course of a season, and how these can be *in-sync*, 
leading to long periods of consistent results (wins or losses), or *out-of-sync*, leading to a one-step-forward-one-step-back feeling.

Give them a try and let me know what you think.

I am in the process of developing a couple more apps, but I still have a lot of work to do before they will be ready to go live. When they are complete, 
I will add them to the [Apps](/applications/) page. 

<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mQoI_a_toU" target = "_blank">Zerts</a> are also in progress.
