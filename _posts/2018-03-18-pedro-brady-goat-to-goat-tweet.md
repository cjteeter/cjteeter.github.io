I primarily use the Twitter *Like* button as a bookmarking tool for interesting-seeming articles. Recently, I had some time to go
through a bunch of the tweets I liked and read the corresponding articles. These included great pieces from *The Ringer*'s
Ben Lindbergh on <a href = 'https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2018/2/21/17035624/mlb-revenue-sharing-owners-players-free-agency-rob-manfred' target = '_blank'> baseball's economics</a>,
and the <a href = 'https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2018/2/20/17030428/sherri-nichols-baseball-sabermetric-movement' target = '_blank'> foremother of sabermetrics, Sherri Nichols</a>.
And Ringer-colleague, Katie Baker's fascinating profile of <a href = 'https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2017/10/25/16539596/alex-rodriguez-redemption-mlb-on-fox-world-series' target = '_blank'> Alex Rodriguez</a>.
They also included the excellent article about Los Angeles Dodgers General Manager, Farhan Zaidi's <a href = 'http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-dodgers-zaidi-fantasy-football-20180223-story.html' target = '_blank'> fantasy football dynasty</a>
by Andy McCullough of the *Los Angeles Times*. Alan Sepinwall's piece on ignoring the fear of missing out on new-peak-TV and <a href = 'https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/in-defense-of-watching-old-shows-in-peak-tv/' target = '_blank'> embracing old favourites</a>.
A series of great review/interview pieces on Ken Burns and Lynn Novick's excellent documentary on <a href = 'http://kenburns.com/films/vietnam/' target = '_blank'> the Vietnam War</a>.
A thorough takedown of the shoddy work by <a href = 'https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking?utm_term=.gmWa0beyo#.daOOd05mo' target = '_blank'> famous 'food scientist' Brian Wansink</a>
by Stephanie Lee at *Buzzfeed News*, and brilliant statistician, Andrew Gelman's commentary on the matter, specifically about <a href = 'http://andrewgelman.com/2018/02/27/no-researchers-not-typically-set-prove-specific-hypothesis-study-begins/' target = '_blank'> how science and data analysis should be conducted</a>. 
Oh, and I can't leave out this remarkable essay about <a href = 'https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n16/john-lanchester/you-are-the-product' target = '_blank'> how Facebook is terrible</a>.

There are probably others that I should be directing people toward, but those in the previous paragraph are the ones for which I made a note to mention. But they are not even
my reason for this post. Rather, this silly little post is due to a tweet from the New England Patriots that was mixed in amongst the mess of tweets/articles 
I have *liked* over the last few years:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check this out - Brady &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/45PedroMartinez?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@45PedroMartinez</a> just did a little batting practice at Fenway: <a href="http://t.co/ddCtQ1qxGP">pic.twitter.com/ddCtQ1qxGP</a></p>&mdash; New England Patriots (@Patriots) <a href="https://twitter.com/Patriots/status/587700187839275009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2015</a></blockquote>

As the tweet states, that is Pedro Martinez throwing a bit of batting practice for Tom Brady! Be still my heart. 

These guys are legends in Boston and in their respective sports. What a cool thing to have happen. Brady takes some good hacks, perhaps harder
than Pedro was expecting given the reaction. Brady can handle a bat, he was actually drafted by the Montreal Expos in 1995, but passed on the
opportunity to continue his football career -- a decision that seems to have worked out ok for him.

Anyway, I wanted to note my re-stumbling onto this great moment.
