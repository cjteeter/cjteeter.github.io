I have another entry in the [2017 BP Boston Roster Recap series](http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017-red-sox-roster-recap-series/) up on the site. This time around, I recapped run-of-the-mill 
middle-reliever, Heath Hembree's season. A few years ago, Hembree, then part of the San Francisco Giants' system, was projected 
as a high-level, power arm and handed the Closer-of-the-future moniker. Well, it turns out that projection missed the mark by a 
considerable amount. The Red Sox acquired Hembree at the 2014 trade deadline in exchange for Jake Peavy. Since then he has 
developed into a catch-all, fringy middle reliever, which is disappointing. With that said, he had success in 2016 in his role 
and his flexibility and ability to throw multiple innings certainly saved the team in a number of games. But he had tremendous 
difficulty against left-handed batters, has yet to show that he should be given a more important role, and as such will be 
fighting for his place in the organization every time he takes the mound in 2017.
