This week at BP Boston I revisited the idea of an <a href = "http://www.cteeter.ca/blog/2017-08-03-offense-variation-run-scoring/" target = "_blank"> offense's variation in run scoring</a>.
Specifically I looked at the Red Sox's offense strong production in August. The bats have come alive and as a result the Red Sox have been scoring in bunches, and doing so consistently.
This has made life much easier for the pitching staff, which is welcome, considering the recent struggles of the relievers.
Ideally the offense keeps this level of run scoring the rest of the way and into the playoffs, although that is asking a lot.

Head over to BP Boston to read about the recent boom from Red Sox's offense: <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017/08/22/peaking-with-consistency/" target = "_blank"> Peaking with Consistency.</a>
