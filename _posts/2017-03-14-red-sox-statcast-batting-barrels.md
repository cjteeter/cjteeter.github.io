This week at BP Boston I wrote the Red Sox's offense from the perspective of a metric derived from the new (and exciting)
Statcast data: barrels. A barrel is a batted ball with an exit velocity and launch angle that has tended to result in
extra-base hits. In 2016, the Red Sox as a group were not outstanding in their ability to barrel-up the ball, but a few
players were above average. Having a lineup full of barrelers is one path to a successful offense, but as the 2016 Red Sox
showed, stringing together singles, doubles and walks in front of just a few barrelers will also work out just fine. 

Head over to BP Boston and read my work: [The Red Sox's Barrel Blast](http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017/03/14/the-red-soxs-barrel-blast/).

Speier is an excellent Red Sox beat writer for The Boston Globe, so it is nice to have his recognition. Here is what he wrote about my article:

> *BARREL BONANZA: Chris Teeter of Baseball Prospectus [examines the quality of contact made by members of the Red Sox in 2016](http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017/03/14/the-red-soxs-barrel-blast/). While David Ortiz produced consistently great contact that will be hard to replace, Teeter finds that Moreland showed a reliable ability to produce “barrels” – a Statcast measurement of balls with a launch angle and exit velocity likely to result in extra-base hits.*
