This week at BP Boston I wrote about their major offseason acquisition, Chris Sale. Sale is an excellent pitcher 
-- in the top five in the league over the last five years -- but there are concerns about him moving from pitching in the soft 
American League Central to the difficult American League East. I examined this idea by looking at Sale's career splits against 
AL East teams and in AL East ballparks, and then waded into the muck of specific batter-pitcher matchups to see if there are any 
batters currently residing in the AL East with whom Sale has had difficulty.
