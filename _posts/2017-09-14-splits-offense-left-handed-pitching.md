This week at BP Boston I took another poke at the Red Sox's offense. They have struggled mightily against left-handed pitching this 
season, which is odd considering the group of strong right-handed hitters in the lineup and that they get to play in Fenway Park half
of the time; a stadium known for being difficult on lefty pitchers. Despite these characteristics of the team they just have not been
getting it done when the opposing team has a lefty on the bump. For the most part this is because Hanley Ramirez, Chris Young and 
Xander Bogaerts have been awful. So much so that it is worth wondering whether Hanley should start taking a reduced role, and whether Young's spot
as lefty-mashing-fourth-outfielder should be given to Bryce Brentz.

I am not thrilled with the quality of this work, but head over to BP Boston and read more on the Red Sox's difficulty hitting left-handed pitching:
