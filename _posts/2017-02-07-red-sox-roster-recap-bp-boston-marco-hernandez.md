My fifth (and perhaps last) entry in the <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017-red-sox-roster-recap-series/" target = "_blank"> 2017 BP Boston Roster Recap series</a> went up on the site last week. I reviewed Marco 
Hernandez's season. Hernandez is an interesting young player, who does not necessarily stand out in any way but will be a 
solid option off the bench for the Red Sox in 2017. I would be surprised if he does not earn one of the four (or five) bench 
roles right out of Spring Training. Now, three of those bench roles are already spoken for by Christian Vazquez, Chris Young, 
and Brock Holt. This means that Hernandez will be battling for the last spot (or one of the last two spots) with Josh Rutledge 
and, well, I don't think there is anybody else who is clearly in the mix for that last spot.

Head over to BP Boston and read about Hernandez's skillset: <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017/01/31/roster-recap-marco-hernandez-keeps-hitting/" target = "_blank"> Roster Recap: Marco Hernandez Keeps Hitting</a>.
