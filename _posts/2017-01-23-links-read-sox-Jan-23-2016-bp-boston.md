I wrote last week's Read Sox article at BP Boston. In the "Going Deep" section of the article I focused on how the Red Sox 
should organize their batting order so as to maximize the run scoring potential. In the remainder of the article I highlighted 
stories on how the free agent market for sluggers has been depressed, how the starting rotation will be filled out behind 
Chris Sale, David Price and Rick Porcello, how the Red Sox use a development program to initiate their prospects to life in the 
big leagues, how Rusney Castillo has breathed life back into his career, and how Carson Smith's return to the big leagues may 
not be as smooth as many of us are expecting.

This was a fun edition to write. Go check it out:
