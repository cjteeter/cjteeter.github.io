My first entry into this year's *Roster Recap Series* at BP Boston went up today. I dug into Eduardo Nunez's time with the Red Sox. Nunez
came to the team in a trade deadline acquisition that many, including me, thought was an underwhelming addition. Well, for six weeks
Nunez did everything he could to demonstrate just how wrong people like me were. Unfortunately a knee injury and two aggravations of it
made the end of his season a bit of a downer. 

Nunez, a free agent this offseason, would be an excellent addition to the Red Sox roster for 2018 (and maybe 2019).
He could cover second base while Dustin Pedroia works his way back from his knee surgery, and could then slide into a super-utility role. 
While that sounds great for the Red Sox, I suspect Nunez will get a better offer elsewhere. 

Head over to BP Boston to read more about Eduardo Nunez's brief, but productive, stint as a Red Sox: <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/2017/11/09/roster-recap-the-underwhelming-eduardo-nunez/" target = "_blank"> Roster Recap: The "Underwhelming" Eduardo Nunez</a>.
