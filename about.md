Welcome! This is my personal website and blog, where you will (mostly) find my research, analysis, and writing about the game of baseball. Right now I am something of a free agent, as I am not writing for an outlet other than this site. Over the last few years I worked as a columnist at <a href ="http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/" target = "_blank"> Baseball Prospectus Boston</a>, where I focused on covering the Boston Red Sox. BP Boston is part of <a href = "http://www.baseballprospectus.com/" target = "_blank"> Baseball Prospectus</a>, which is one of baseball's leading analytical outlets. The Boston local-site was an excellent source for Red Sox content, but has dramatically slowed down. If you are looking for a direct link to my writing, you can find it <a href = "http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/author/christopherteeter/" target = "_blank"> here</a>. Prior to writing at BP Boston, I wrote at <a href = "http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/" target  = "_blank"> Beyond the Box Score</a>; initially as a contributor, and then as a featured writer and editor. An archive of my work at BtBS can be found [here]({{site.url}}/btbs_archive/). 

Before getting myself into baseball analysis and writing, I trained as a cognitive psychologist. I completed an undergraduate degree in psychology at <a href = "http://www.mta.ca" target = "_blank"> Mount Allison University</a>, and then completed my Ph.D. at <a href = "https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/pnb/" target = "_blank"> McMaster University</a>. My doctoral research focused on understanding the human spatial memory system. Specifically, I examined spatial reference frames and the contribution of body-based information for spatial updating. After completing my doctoral degree, I started a postdoctoral fellowship in the Applied Cognition in Education Laboratory at McMaster University. My postdoctoral fellowship was centered around applying established principles of human memory and attention to refining processes of teaching and learning. While I have not been active in this field for many years, I am still very interested in the topic and the higher education system in Canada. As such, I am currently working as a Policy and Research Analyst at the <a href = "http://www.mphec.ca" target = "_blank"> Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission (MPHEC)</a>.
