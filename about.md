Welcome! This is my personal website and blog, where you will (mostly) find my research, analysis, and writing about the game of baseball. 
Currently, I am a columnist at [Baseball Prospectus Boston](http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/),
where I focus on the Boston Red Sox. BP Boston is a great site for Red Sox content so I encourage you to check it out, but if you are most 
interested in my writing you can find it [here](http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/author/christopherteeter/). Before starting at 
BP Boston, I worked at [Beyond the Box Score](http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/) initially as a contributor, and then as a featured writer 
and editor. I no longer write there but my work still exists [here](http://www.sbnation.com/users/Chris%20Teeter/blog).

Before getting myself into baseball writing and analysis, I trained as a cognitive psychologist. I completed my undergraduate degree in psychology at [Mount Allison University](http://www.mta.ca), 
before moving on to complete my Ph.D. at [McMaster University](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/pnb/). My doctoral research was focused on 
understanding the human spatial memory system. I examined spatial reference frames and the contribution of body-based information for spatial 
updating. After completing my doctoral degree in September of 2011, I immediately began working as a postdoctoral fellow in the Applied 
Cognition in Education Laboratory. My postdoctoral research focused on applying principles of memory and attention to teaching and learning. 
While I have not been active in the field for the last few years, I am still very interested in this topic and the improvement of the higher 
education system in Canada. For more information, check out my [academic life](/academic/) page. My scientific training informs the way I analyze
and write about baseball. 

I will (irregularly) update this site with my writing that is published on other websites, as well as any of my analysis that is not published elsewhere, 
and perhaps my thoughts on other topics that interest me. My [previous website](https://christopherteeter.wordpress.com/) has a complete pre-2017 
writing archive.
