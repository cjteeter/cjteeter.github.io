Welcome! This is my personal website and blog, where you will (mostly) find my research, analysis, and writing about the game of baseball. I tend to
approach my analysis of the game from an analytical perspective. Currently, I am a columnist at [Baseball Prospectus Boston](http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/),
where I focus on the Boston Red Sox. BP Boston is part of [Baseball Prospectus](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/), which is one of baseball's leading analytical outlets.
The Boston local-site is an excellent site for Red Sox content so I encourage you to check it all out, but if you are looking for a
direct link to my writing, you can find it [here](http://boston.locals.baseballprospectus.com/author/christopherteeter/). Prior to writing at
BP Boston, I wrote at [Beyond the Box Score](http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/); initially as a contributor, and then as a featured writer 
and editor. I no longer write at BtBS but my work still exists [here](http://www.sbnation.com/users/Chris%20Teeter/blog).

Before getting myself into baseball analysis and writing, I trained as a cognitive psychologist. I completed an undergraduate degree in psychology at [Mount Allison University](http://www.mta.ca), 
and then completed a Ph.D. at [McMaster University](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/pnb/). My doctoral research focused on
understanding the human spatial memory system. Specifically, I examined spatial reference frames and the contribution of body-based information for spatial 
updating. After completing my doctoral degree, I started a postdoctoral fellowship in the Applied Cognition in Education Laboratory at McMaster University.
My postdoctoral fellowship was centred around applying established principles of human memory and attention to refining processes of teaching and learning. 
While I have not been active in the field for the last few years, I am still very interested in this topic and the higher education system in Canada. As such,
I am currently working as a Policy and Research Analyst at the [Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission (MPHEC)](http://www.mphec.ca). For more 
information on my past academic pursuits, check out my [academic life](/academic/) page. 

I intend on regularly updating this site with my baseball-related work that gets published on other websites, as well as any of my analysis that is not published elsewhere, 
and perhaps thoughts on other (non-baseball) topics that interest me. My [previous website](https://christopherteeter.wordpress.com/) has a complete pre-2017 
writing archive.
